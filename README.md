# Tensor-library
Analogue to Math and ML libraries like numpy or pytorch  
From scratch in plain java  

## Features
* Tensors
* Operations: transposition, matrix multiplication, convolution etc.
* Convenient creation of your own operations
* Dynamic computation graphs
* AutoGrad

## Usage Tips
* Build Machine and Deep Learning models  
* [Build Computer Vision algorithms](github.com/Alar-q/ML_library_JavaFX)
* Physical calculations

#### Disadvantage  
Element-by-element execution of operations, without GPU acceleration of calculations.  
I would like to add this feature, but learning OpenCL will take a lot of time. 
#### Explanation why I won't continue
"The problem with programmers   
is that when they make a car,  
they are at the same time, reinvent  
the wheel, steel mining methods 
and traffic rules"
